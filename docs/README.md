# The Chess Express

Principal developers: [@mitaleeb](github.com/mitaleeb) [@dbisk](github.com/dbisk)

## Abstract

This project is inspired by "Wizard Chess", introduced in _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_. It is an automagically moving chessboard, utilizing metal feet on the chesspieces and an electromagnet in order to move pieces around the board. Internally, the project uses an X-Y plotter setup with belts and stepper motors to accurately move the electromagnet head to the location of the pieces, and to accurately drag the pieces to their new positions. The Chess Express also automatically moves pieces to a "graveyard" once they've been taken, and given a promotion is able to move dead pieces back onto the board.
